                <aside class="quote"><q> <strong>Programming</strong> is hard by it's nature but when you make the commitment this becomes a <strong>Play</strong></q></aside>
                
                <!--First Paragraph-->
                <p>Have you ever found that learning something is difficult in your life? Have you ever wondered why? Then let us investigate why. Simply by observing Why is it easier to play a game? rather than learning something new.
                    Because it creates a particular chemistry in the body and psyche. This specific chemistry establishes a pattern of happiness in the system, which is why things get easier mentally. The same phenomenon happens after five hours of viewing a movie.
                    You already know every aspect in the movie, you waste no time, and you absorb all of the information in the movie.</p>
                    
                <!--Second Quote-->    
                <div class="quote2"><q><Strong>Watching</strong> a certain movie for five hours seems so fast while <strong>learning/studying</strong> something in hour seems a day.</q></div>
                
                <!--Paragraph-->
                <p>Now, let's get back to <strong>Programming</strong> programming is hard by it's nature but when you make the commitment that whatever happens you should do it and learn it. <i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb-on"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb-on"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-lightbulb-on"></i> First step is you need to create this certain chemistry that you <q>want to learn</q>.</p>
                <br><p>Keep it intense to you, it will take a lot of pain but sure it is worth it, i guarantee you that!</p><br> By watching a movie you created a chemistry unconsciously but this time you have to be conscious to yourself and start doing the hard way. There's no shortcut to this, you have to learn how to effectively learn.</p>
                
                <!--Similar to second quote-->
                <div class="quote2"><q>You start <Strong>small</strong> then you become <strong>big.</strong> No one start at level 10, we all start from nothing or zero!</q></div>

                <p>Ofcourse you don't know which way you are going, you don't know anything at all. This will become very hard, that is why you need to do it consciously you have to be in the process of making, make this commitment today!</p>
